## Resolver functions take four arguments:
- Parent: The return value of the previous resolver in the resolver chain. For top-level resolvers, the parent is `undefined` when no previous resolvers have been called
- Args: The argument carries the parameters of the query e.g. post.id
- Context: An object that the resolver can read and write to/from, enabling resolvers to share information
- Info: An AST (Abstract syntax tree) representation of the query/mutation
